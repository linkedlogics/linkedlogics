### Linked-Logics Framework

Linked-Logics is a decentralized workflow execution engine for building distributed, resilient and scalable applications. Linked-Logics is a different implementation of [EPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_process_chain) and a good candidate for introducing [Sagas](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) in microservices. 

It comes with simplicty and minimal framework footprint. It is very easy to use and high performant.

Main features:
- It is decentralized (no single point of failure)
- It is fully event-driven
- It is backed by Kafka, RabbitMQ etc.
- It has minimal framework footprint (just one single annotation)
- It provides very powerfull DSL for building workflows
- It supports expression language to customize workflows
